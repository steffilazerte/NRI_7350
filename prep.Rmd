We are going to be covering a lot in our R sessions, so to give us a jump start, I've compiled some things you should have done before coming:

1. [Run through 1+ RStudio R primers](#primers)
2. [Install R (Update R)](#install)
3. [Install RStudio (Update RStudio)](#rstudio)
4. [Install `tidyverse` packages (Update `tidyverse` packages)](#tidyverse)
5. [Install a couple of extra packages](#packages)

> **IMPORTANT!**:  
> If you have any problems installing the software or packages, [please contact me](contact.html) before class so we can sort out any problems

------------------------

# Instructions

## 1. Run through 1+ RStudio R primers

Please complete the [RStudio Programming Basics Primer](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2). 

You can complete it online and it'll give you a quick introduction to R coding which 
is will be a great way to get up to speed on the basics before we jump in.

Feel free to run through other [RStudio Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers).


## 2. Install R (Update R) {#install}

> Even if you already have R installed, **please update it**, so we're all working with the same version


Depending on your operating system, you can install R in one of the following ways:

__Windows__

- Go to the Windows download page: <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/>
- Download and install R for windows (the link at the top)

__Mac__  

- Go to the Mac OS X download page: <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>
- Download and install the version that matches your Mac OS X

__Linux: Debian/Ubuntu__

- Specific details: <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README.html>
- Add one of the CRAN repositories to you apt (otherwise your R will be out of date)


## 3. Install RStudio {#rstudio}

> Even if you already have RStudio installed, **please update it**, so we're all working with the same version

- For all Operating systems (i.e., Windows, Mac Os, Linux, etc.) go to RStudio's download page:  <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download>
- Download and install the __installer__ that matches your system (i.e. select your link from the top options, not the Zip/Tarball options)

Open RStudio <img src="figures/RStudio-Ball.png" alt="RStudio Logo" style="height: 30px;"/> **not R** <img src="figures/R.png" alt="R Logo" style="height: 30px;"/>. RStudio automatically opens R for you in the 'Console' pane

**Verify that your version of R by looking at the first line of the console (left or lower left pane), you should see something like this:**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(glue)
library(magrittr)

R.version %>%
  glue_data(
    "{version.string} -- {nickname}",
    "Copyright (C) {year} The R Foundation for Statistical Computing",
    "Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)",
    "",
    "R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.",
    "You are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.",
    "Type 'license()' or 'licence()' for distribution details.",
    "",
    "  Natural language support but running in an English locale",
    "",
    "R is a collaborative project with many contributors.",
    "Type 'contributors()' for more information and",
    "'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.",
    "",
    "Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or",
    "'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.",
    "Type 'q()' to quit R.", .sep = "\n") %>%
  cat()
```

The important line is the first one: `r glue("{R.version.string} -- {R.Version()$nickname}")`

## 4a) Install `tidyverse` package {#tidyverse}

Packages are extensions or add-ons for R. You will use many different ones over the course of your work with R. `tidyverse` is name of a collection of newer packages for data management.

In RStudio:

- Click on the 'Packages' tab in the lower right hand corner
- Click on the 'Install' button right below the tab
- Type 'tidyverse' into the 'Packages' box, and click on 'Install'

<img src="figures/A1_packages_edit.png" alt="RStudio Packages Tab" style="height: 500px;"/>

- This may take a while (you will see lots of download text in red in your console)
- When it's finished, you should see a message similar this one to in the console (lower left hand pane)

```
* DONE (tidyverse)

The downloaded source packages are in
	‘/tmp/RtmpACWq9S/downloaded_packages’
> 
```

- Test that your installation had no problems by typing `library("tidyverse")` into the console and hitting enter. You should see something like this (**Note:** These are messages, not errors!):

```{r, messages = TRUE}
library("tidyverse")
```

> ## Problems?
> - If you already had R/RStudio installed, try removing them both and installing everything from scratch
> - If you get an error about a problem installing a specific package, try installing that package invidiually (search for it in the install packages menu)
> - Try installing the packages we need by hand: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `ggplot2`, `skimr`
> - [Contact Steffi](contact.html)


## 4b) Update `tidyverse`

**This is only necessary if you already have a version of `tidyverse` installed.**

In RStudio:    

- Click on on the 'Update' button next to the 'Install' button
- Click on 'Select All' button
- Click on 'Install Updates' button
- **Repeat** until there are no new updates

## 5. Install some other packages {#packages}

We'll also be using a couple of other packages that are not included in the `tidyverse` so let's make sure you have them installed. We will be using more packages than this, but this will get you ready for the first labs.

- `palmerpenguins`
- `janitor`
- `readxl`

You can install them the same way you installed `tidyverse`

OR you can use the command line and type the following into the console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("palmerpenguins", "janitor", "readxl"))
```


__Congratulations! Now you're ready to get into the fun stuff :)__
